    severity: ERROR
    message: >
      The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but
      it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing
      arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated. When a weakness allocates
      excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack
      exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical
      impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.
