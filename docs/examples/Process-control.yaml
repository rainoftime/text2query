    severity: WARNING
    message: >
      Executing commands or loading libraries from an untrusted source or in an
      untrusted environment can cause an application to execute malicious
      commands (and payloads) on behalf of an attacker. Process control
      vulnerabilities take two forms: An attacker can change the command that
      the program executes: the attacker explicitly controls what the command
      is. An attacker can change the environment in which the command executes:
      the attacker implicitly controls what the command means. Process control
      vulnerabilities of the first type occur when either data enters the
      application from an untrusted source and the data is used as part of a
      string representing a command that is executed by the application. By
      executing the command, the application gives an attacker a privilege or
      capability that the attacker would not otherwise have.
